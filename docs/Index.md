## Concept

Provide a free-to-use / open-source, creator-centred platform for hosting audio-based recordings, and their respective scripts, of fictional stories. 

The app focuses primarily on the relationship between story-writers and third-party voice actors, ensuring they are rewarded equally for their content.
The UX will be tailored to strongly advertise the links between content sources.
Instances of audio / video should strongly disclose the source-material, with easy to access links.
Instances of scripts should exhibit all their third-party content on their record.

A balance should be reached that ensures the platform is healthy for both creators and consumers. Successful creators should have their work spotlighted. New creators should have a chance to become successful.

The platform will allow 18+ content, so necessary legal and ethical actions will be required.

The platform is intended to be non-profit, and more of a portfolio project. I intend to release it to the public nonetheless, in order to get the experience of releasing a product.

## Existing Solution

The platform is intended to be a more suitable implementation of the (18+) [GoneWildAudio Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/) system.

GWA seperates scripts, and their third-party 'covers' into seperate posts. This creates a divide between the content sources.

### Content Links

It is custom for third-parties to include a HTML link within their post to the post made by the script writer. This serves the purpose of providing credit, as well as publicity to the 'original creator'.
It could be argued though, that referencing primarily through a link provides a "weak level of observability", at least in the regards to what is capable with web-tech.

Additionally, script posts do not provide links to third-party covers of the work. Due to the functions of Reddit, they cannot easily link to posts created in the future. Reddit allows them to edit a post after its creation, allowing them to add links to covers once they appear. However this requires unneccesary action from the content creator.

In essence, content links are 'one-way', and the currently used referencing system is weak, as it could support creators better.

### Content Hosting

The majority of audio posts on the GWA subreddit host their audio externally on [Soundgasm](https://soundgasm.net/). 
This presents another flaw, in that creators are required to manage their content across two platforms. From a UX perspective this is somewhat inefficient. However it could be argued that this allows for content to be shared across many platforms, with a single point of upload. 

Should Soundgasm be fully realised (in the way described on their website), their solution would be similar to this project.

## M-V-P

Posts are created anonymously. This may require banning 18+ content for legal and ethical reasons, as there are no accounts.

Posts can contain text, scripts, audio and video content, along with a title.

Third-party posts are strongly linked to original posts. 
Posts hold links to additional posts derived from it.
Derived posts are linked to original post.

Posts can be discovered through entering the title into a search bar.
Posts can be discovered through an explore tab, that orders posts in chronological order (newest posts first).

All posts are shareable through unique links.
